##### Summary
"Estate Sale" is an ongoing series that ties memory to the marks on objects we leave behind. For these specific pieces, poems written about daily objects I grew up with have been typed on stationary belonging to my grandparent's restaurant.

**Transcript**

I wonder what they did\
to your old waterbed, the one\
with the duct-taped thermostat\
on the side.

Is that the sort of item you label\
kitsch — dis-assemble and pile\
onto the curb?

Or did it get wrapped, carefully\
carted and hauled to the highest\
bidder?

Does it too trace the patterns\
of a different-colored ceiling\
and wonder when\
this became home?
