##### Summary
"Estate Sale" is an ongoing series that ties memory to the marks on objects we leave behind. For these specific pieces, poems written about daily objects I grew up with have been typed on stationary belonging to my grandparent's restaurant.

Painted over in thick white\
the inner drawer stained by\
a fountain pen, gifted but never used.\
Glitter wedged into crevices,\
source: UNKNOWN — nicks by a handle\
storing knacks that you kept\
"just in case"
