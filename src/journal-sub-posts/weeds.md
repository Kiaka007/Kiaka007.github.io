##### Weeds
I cut my hair off  
to look like a Spice Girl

It’s not something parents  
will tell you,

Why the other girls make  
me the Yellow Power Ranger.  
Laugh when I wear the Red  
lipstick. Call me Dog  
when we play house.

Pull and brush, but the ends  
shrink to my scalp. I want to rip  
them out and be bald.

I wish I could regrow, pale  
as cream, crowned in ruby  
or gold like Cinderella,  
like Aurora, like my  
Mother

but I am not my Mother  
and these curls are not waves of grain.  

They are tendrils tied  
to a dark root, thick  
from being torn, sick  
of trying to bloom for those  
that call us — Weeds
