#### Figure Drawing Class
*Progression over 8 weeks*

As a part of my artist recovery I decided to enroll in an 8 week live figure drawing class. Drawing, being such an important foundation to any art, has been a sore spot for me for years, given that my entry into the arts was music and performance. What I loved about this experience was that my attitude going into it was not aimed at mastery but aimed at exploration and fun. With that mindset, I truly enjoyed each class, I made friends, and I think I unlocked a new understanding of how to really observe what's in front me before trying to capture it on paper.
