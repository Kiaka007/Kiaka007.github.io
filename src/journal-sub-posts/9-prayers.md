#### 9 Prayers for 2 Daughters (WIP)
##### I. December 17, 1991
I came into this world between two legs  
of doubt&emsp;a mouth stretched to scream  
then sewn shut, as I cried out against   
glass walls&emsp;your echo

##### II. Miracle Baby
I am the second daughter to live   
the third to be born.  
Emptiness: the cocoon I slept in,   
for 9 months between&emsp;your prayers  
I held my breath, grew my chest  
to fill&emsp;&emsp;the aching.

I was in the room  
when the doctor’s sentence came    
*She’s too small*  
I was in the room that night   
to rock with you   
in your weeping.

*My miracle child* you would tell me  
*you are*   
*My miracle*   
*child*

##### III. Oaken Bucket Drive
After you left, everything shifted but the furniture.  
Dad would say, “your Mother was always better   
at figuring out what goes where, so&emsp;why change it up?”

I think,  
he just couldn’t let that part of his life go.  
He could be so—certain  
about people.

It must have been difficult being with someone  
who had a clearer picture for your life than you did.  
Even still—you tried to make it your own.

I remember,  
Hanging a garden box by the bay window,  
for our herbs to grow.   
Floral prints on a couch with a pull-out   
for when Nanny stays  
Bright yellow wallpaper laid, in the kitchen  
like the one back home.  
A large glass table in the dining room,  
for when guests would come.

But the soil in Memphis was sandy,   
none of your plants took root.  
And the drive from Pittsburgh was long  
we didn’t receive many guests.

It was the four of us, with a fifth on the way  
filling spaces made with different plans in mind.  
Daily, our routines set you as a fixture.  
Slowly, our words grew muddied and drawled,  
so foreign to your Mother’s—tongue each word  
deepened her absence.

Oaken Bucket Drive was where  
I received my name.

Oaken Bucket Drive was where  
you lost yours.

My sister and I never say it aloud,  
but deep down, I think  
we understand.
