##### “Doo Wop” (That Thing)
Come on girl, give a fella  
a shine—you got that thing  
That love me long time,  
That add a dime—to the price  
of a vase cause it come from  
the place—where women bow girl  
keep that smile girl, that thing,  
that thing.

Teeth stained black girl  
there’s no back girl  
Red lips were made to be  
silent.

Look out, Look out  
the Devil works through kneading hands  
Watch out, Watch out  
at massage parlors where yen  
means men with pens will come  
to prey—after church on Sundays.

Bleach yellow to white  
O’ BA BA san the beating  
Run straight home at night  
KA KA san the pleading inside  
the seething, needing,   
heeding to—a win, win  
come again? You ain’t no  
jin, maybe a Chin, there’s  
no restitution for that thing,  
that thing, that thing.
