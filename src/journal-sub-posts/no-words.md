##### With No Words
With no words a child knows  
to open their mouth to say “more”

On Sundays we’re taught to close  
our mouths and pray more.

On Friday I got your call  
it clicked the calling.

Past me, Future me  
they were quickly becoming

I became the engine that filled the sky  
with smoke. A mantra became my pillow  
and then my blindfold.

Past me, Future me  
all they wanted was more

My feet raced towards Father Time  
but our time was cut short.

You wore sacrifice as a cloak to muffle  
your pleading. Until the end, then as a child  
you were reaching—for three words

I no longer get to say.
