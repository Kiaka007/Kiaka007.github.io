##### American Cannibal
He pressed,  
the ends of his fork impaling  
over and over, white teeth bared  
a creak in the wood as his chair rocked  
on the floor boards, trees twisted  
to a square, a pretense of evolution.

Our eyes lit altars for idols born  
from the hunger, to fill places  
we do not wish to see.  

Kings coronated from the mounds  
we packed with hands that could not  
hold anything but throats.  

Hope, plucked from skins  
as we extend our necks  
weighed down by the apples  
in our mouths.
