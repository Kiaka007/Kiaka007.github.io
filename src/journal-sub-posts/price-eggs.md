##### The Price of Eggs
We are grown before we are born  
our legs strengthened to run  
errands. Do you feel the squeeze  
on the morning train? The thin membrane  
forming? In each of us is a chick  
thrashing and screaming against a shell.

##### Birds on a Wire
I had a dream that my feet were swaddled  
in white cloth bound&emsp;by that plastic wire  
used to hang chickens when they are pulled  
from the coop&emsp;Here virtue&emsp;is a head bowed  
to receive bread&emsp;I prayed to gloved hands  
rubbed palms for men &emsp;lit by doorways  
Their routine&emsp;our ritual&emsp;A machine’s hum  
that echoed&emsp;within our cages like a hymn  
it rang out

&emsp;&emsp;*O’ devout ones, please forsake your feathers!*  
&emsp;&emsp;*O’ pious ones, please offer your eggs!*  
&emsp;&emsp;*You will hunger no longer,*  
&emsp;&emsp;*There is a place for you.*  
&emsp;&emsp;*There is a place for you.*

We didn’t know the cost&emsp;of saying yes  
was to stuff our lungs&emsp;with Zoom meeting  
chants&emsp;to birth from our breasts&emsp;chicks  
that would hatch&emsp;in board rooms&emsp;where doors  
slam shut&emsp;Plead on our knees&emsp;for the duds  
dutifully discarded as slops to fill  
our buckets&emsp;with something more&emsp;than words

We have forgotten&emsp;how&emsp;to kick&emsp;our feet  
to beat&emsp;our wings  
we do not question&emsp;whether this dream  
is ours.
