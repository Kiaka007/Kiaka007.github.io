##### A Cliff and A Tide
Drops teeter in their resolve  
to jump. I too felt the swift, click,  
lock of my chest as space grew short,  
then long. We hovered.

Your gaze glazed from a horizon line.  
Mine paused on the poc holes of  
your cheeks—the sprinkle  
of your peppery beard.

I inhaled,  
but couldn’t bring myself to ask.  
You knew,  
but couldn’t bring yourself to say  
so we stayed—silent  
and let the sounds of the swells  
speak for us.
