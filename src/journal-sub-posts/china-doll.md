##### China Doll
Not a garden snake,  
I need a King Cobra—  
pivot my hips, peer in  
your mirror—

Eyes slant down, begin  
my tutor—  
head bent bow, repeat  
my ancestors—

*You not laughin’ now*  
&emsp;*do you not laugh?*

Wheel the clay in, smack   
it from the back—

*Grab her throat,*  
&emsp;*she tryna wrestle* 

Pound ‘til thin, fill  
thy vessel—

*She wanna gag,*  
&emsp;*she wanna choke*

throw wood to pyre—  
preen and stoke—*My little China Doll*  
crafted by your hand  
coronating in the reflection

—become a man
