Each morning I feel my chest rise  
collapse—my eyes face up then reel  
back—in waking.

I imagine myself a tree and you  
the root—you who taught me to reach  
Watch! as I take this hand, splay  
fingers like leaves and grab the Sun.

But there’s a rope—my sternum  
anchored to a floral couch on  
Oaken Bucket Drive where a van waits  
out front and James Taylor sings.

I am here—your eyes do not open  
I am here—your chest will not rise  
I am here—still  
&emsp;as I whisper  
&emsp;&emsp;“Dad, I love you”
