For graduate school application, I have been tasked to describe, the meaningful moments in my life. The moments that have influenced my unique view as a designer and researcher. Unfortunately, to a generalist and overall fluid thinker such as myself, you might as well ask me to write a memoir. Pinging between observations of the seemingly mundane like a child dropping their icecream, to the more world shaking events of the death of a loved one, my mind tends to connect the most seemingly unconnected memories. Perhaps the discipline to sort these memories is why I journal and enjoy poetry so much. With that said, the below poem was a first step to me organizing my mind behind the prompt. Why did I care so strongly for design? Why do I feel observation and immersion are so important?

##### Personal Essay, a Poem
*Perspective is rooted in the details.*

Dad  
Flakes – of ashened skin dust my Dad’s knuckles as  
he gathers the bulk of blankets and tucks them around   
my shaking hands, shaking his head at the daughter   
who only brought one glove.

Grandma  
Puckered lips – pull in from a pair of missing teeth  
the bite was in her gaze, the tune held in her hum  
When she smiles I smile back.

Grandpa  
Wheat – a single stalk dancing upon the hill  
of his head, next to the wood at our table  
where we would gather, wind building in a silent  
laughter as he reached for the last bowl of rice.

I  
am a time traveller, returning  
again and again, to a new home,  
a new window, a new plot in  
my memory.

*Archeology is the act of digging*

I sow  
&emsp;and I reap  
&emsp;&emsp;and I reap  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;and I reap

Questions scatter uncovered,  
like ants seeking shelter – in a storm I wander   
between yesterday and tomorrow.

*I design to imagine*

Callus – can’t form  
around the eyes, so I cast  
golden light to soften the boundaries.

Wielding metrics like a mirror,   
I flip the screen  
&emsp;&emsp;and write  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;and ask  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;and find  
all the little gaps we hold   
so dear.

I miss lava tag and Jeff Corwin  
the taste of honeysuckle  
off the vine, fishing  
for tadpoles by the pond

*How many members in this meeting can recall   
the smell of rain?*

To observe, I recede  
into the walls and become the night sky.

The North Star with a tender gaze, stays  
amongst the swells, guides ships to shore to meet  
the blinding Dawn. Some truths are best revealed  
in the quiet hum of the morning hours, before  
we realize we are awake.

I am tethered to the pinprick of freshly cut grass  
the sharp inhale of a child about to drop   
their ice cream.

I don’t understand why,  
I care,   
but I do.

Perhaps it’s in my nature to be rooted  
by the details of experience.
