##### Geoffrey Beene
*American Fashion Designer (1924-2004)*

It is always interesting to see a man's take on how to bring out a woman's body, but the work of Geoffrey Beene is one I find captivating. His designs give way to movement, to line. Emotionally there is a balance of desire and empowerment he brings out in his clothes that I think creates an elegance and mystery I find appealing.

Each design has a story that you can make your own and has a structure that invites you to play and to move. I think looking forward he's a designer I'm
interested in knowing more about; his context and how he found his way into fashion.
