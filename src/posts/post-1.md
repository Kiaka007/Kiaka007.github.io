##### Matsumoto Taiyou
*Japanese Mangaka (1967 - )*

There is so much that I love about Matsumoto's illustrations. I love the variety of mark-making he does, from wet on wet to very technical line work.
I love that his subject matter meanders between mundane scenes made whimsical or whimsical scenes made ordinary. I think the thing that pulls me in most though, is that he often creates very understated characters whose personalities come to life through the small details he gives them.

A lion bib, a dropped umbrella, a 1234 jersey, whether a portrait view or a scene, you can often picture an entire world or life attached to the snapshots he gives you.
