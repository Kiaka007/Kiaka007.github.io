##### Georgia O'Keefe
*American Modernist (1887-1986)*

I rediscovered Georgia O'Keeffe in 2023. More than the flower paintings I was taught to observe in school I found a studio book ranging from her work in art school all the way up to her life in Santa Fé.

What I liked most about this view into Georgia was that the book was curated and written by her so it maintained her voice and her motivations. It included anecdotes of how she felt about art as well as sketches of the works before the finals were done. I was blown away by her iterative process of reducing until the essence of the image she wanted revealed itself.

Every image she gave I just couldn't stop staring at. I kept wondering why my eye was so attracted to it. What is it that's so beautiful about a night walk on the beach? A particular vase we've kept? or a mountain road? Sometimes the beauty of things can't be pinned with words, they live in color and form.
