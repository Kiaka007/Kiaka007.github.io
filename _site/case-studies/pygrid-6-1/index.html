                    OpenMined is a non-profit focused on lowering the barrier to using Privacy Preserving Technologies (PETs). Their core product is an opensource Data Science library called PySyft. At the time of this project they had finished initial RnD around a new Differential Privacy mechanism and were looking at ways in which it could be used to help researchers be better stewards of their participants’ data. I was brought on board to investigate viability of incorporating this mechanic into a web app experience. During the time of this project I helped them formalize a theory of change, collaborated with leadership & engineering teams to construct a testable MVP, and coordinated with education & outreach teams to conduct an early access test group of that MVP.

            <article class="portfolio-article">
                <h5>What is Differential Privacy</h5>
                <p class="body-l">
                    I will add a link to a more technical definition below but to simplify, our differential privacy solution identified who the data subjects were in any given dataset. Data subjects can be individuals, entities, or groups. They are the subjects in the dataset that you want to protect, they are the records that the data ties to. Differential Privacy is an algorithm that enforces privacy by obfuscating a result via noise so that you can’t reverse engineer and identify how any one data subject within a dataset contributed to a result. A way to think of it is that it is like an algorithm that creates a “Where’s Waldo” puzzle every time someone wants to identify a data subject. If there are only 5 people in the room then a higher volume of people have to be added to hide Waldo. If Waldo is 7ft tall then a lot of people of varying heights have to be added to the room to hide him.
                </p>
                <p class="body-l">
                    The Differential Privacy mechanism I was to investigate had the ability to identify data subjects labelled across datasets and then furthermore had the ability to track how easily those data subjects could be identified based on what data was released from a computation involving that dataset (we call this unit is called epsilon).

            <article class="portfolio-article">
                <h5>01 // Aligning the Team</h5>
                    <p class="body-l">
                        As this group was at the early stages of product and was unfamiliar with human-centered design methodologies I started by facilitating workshops with leadership and the current working group to define who the audience was and align on what the organization's Theory of Change would be. The outcomes from our workshops helped us define the following:
                    </p>
                    <div class="list-container">
                        <ol class="portfolio-ol">
                            <li>Internal Mantra - We created a phrase to align internal teams on intended impact: “1000x more data unlocked in every scientific field”</li>
                            <li>Key Metrics - We defined the key metrics that would help assess prototype viability</li>
                            <li>Company Programs - We categorized OpenMined current activities into three categories that we then formalized into community programs</li>
                            <li>Audience Definitions - We fleshed out our product audience definitions, breaking down what their potential role would be within the product versus what their role might be in their industry. (Ex: They may be a principal investigator at their university but a data owner within the product.)</li>
                            <li>User Ecosystems - We mapped our assumptions on who might influence our audience most along with potential gaps in resources or education they may have (Ex: They may lack compute resources)</li>
                            <li>Key Shifts - We created “From-To” statements about each audience group that detailed where we believe them to be in contributing to our defined impact and where they would need to be. (Ex: IRB board members going from not knowing how differential privacy works to IRB board members having access to educational resources that explain and map differential privacy implementations to current privacy standards.)</li>

            <article class="portfolio-article">
                <h5>02 // Understanding the User</h5>
                <p class="body-l">Now that we had clarity and alignment on the impact we wanted to make for whom, I wanted us to focus in on a user group and better understand their day to day. We determined that the audience that played the most pivotal role in using the product were what we termed as academic “Data Owners”; academic researchers who had gathered data from study participants (Data Subjects) but who needed to make sure they were good stewards of how that data was used and released.</p>
                <p class="body-l">Qualitative research was conducted primarily through interviews where I spoke with principal investigators at university hospitals about their typical workflows, their day to day challenges, and their specific fears around data misuse. In conjunction with these interviews weekly calls were held with a principal investigator from the Technical University of Munich from which our education team and leadership team were walked through the typical research proposal flow. Any points in that flow where data privacy concerns played a role were then mapped and notated.</p>
                <p class="body-l">The artifacts produced by this phase were:</p>

                        <li>Target Audience Sheets - Continued from our workshops, sheets defining our audience groups were then appended with the sentiments we captured via our interviews. Assumptions were checked and corrected.</li>

            <!--03 IDEATE-->
            <article class="portfolio-article">
                <h5>03 // Ideating On A Testable MVP</h5>
                <p class="body-l">Many interviewees indicated that challenges with outdated approval processes and opaque approval criteria were bottlenecks that stopped their research before data privacy could even be discussed as an issue. We realized that more than a privacy problem the problem set that needed to be addressed first was a collaboration problem. For our MVP we decided to focus on how we could streamline the triaging process behind different stakeholders saying yes or no to data being used for a research project. We called this type of a request a data release request and felt that there was enough traction with this idea to work towards a testable MVP.</p>
                <p class="body-l">For this group I felt it best to ideate via Jeff Patton's <a href="https://jpattonassociates.com/story-mapping/">storymapping framework</a> with slight alterations to better fit the current problem set. Through weekly sessions I held storymapping workshops with the engineering lead, our internal SME, and leadership to determine the core activities our key users would want to conduct when triaging data release requests. We then iterated to determine priority, sectioning off ideas as appropriate for prototyping while others were added to a backlog of “nice to haves”.</p>
                <p class="body-l">The outcome of these activities was a core userflow mapped out for engineering and design to then use in the build process.</p>
            </article>
            <!--04 BUILD-->
            <article class="portfolio-article">
                <h5>04 // Building A Testable MVP</h5>
                <p class="body-l">As far as our MVP bounds, determining “Who” to give data access to as a university department felt out of scope for us to influence. What we could offer instead was a technical solution that could help departments keep track of who has been given data access. Additionally our differential privacy solution could help address the questions of “How much sensitive data is being released with this research project?” and “How much have we revealed about any given study participant (Data Subject) over time?”.</p>
                <p class="body-l">In our MVP, universities could launch a server called a “Domain Node” they could have a public facing server for researchers to join as users and they could have private server(s) to hold data. Researchers added to the system could see a listing of datasets available to research from and could submit requests to compute off of the data. If a guest setting was enabled then non-added researchers could discover the public server and submit a request to sign a Data Access Agreement and join the node. Any Data Access Agreements signed would be tied to their user account with the sign status indicated. </p>
                <p class="body-l">To help researchers explore a dataset before getting full access to it, an admin would be able to allocate each researcher with a “Privacy Budget”. Privacy Budgets in this iteration acted as throttle limits. If a researcher submitted a computation on a dataset their privacy budget would automatically add noise to limit how much epsilon could be spent on any one data subject within the dataset(s) being computed from (See “What is Differential Privacy?” ↑). This would allow some general knowledge on the dataset to be understood without leaking any personally identifying indicators(PII). If automation was enabled, this would enable researchers to more accurately form their projects before having to be brought on premise to compute from the data or before a copy of the data need be released. Additionally we predicted that this would help researchers proactively identify ill-suited datasets or data gaps for their research at the frontend of the proposal process as opposed to finding out at the backend, after all stakeholder approval has been garnered.</p>

                        <li>Upload datasets to the private node. Define who the data subjects are and the perceived min-max ranges of attribute columns in the dataset.

                <p class="body-l">After 3 months of collaboration and iteration our team was able to align on the big picture view of what impact we wanted to make towards the privacy problem; was able to define a theory of change of how our product build efforts, our education efforts, and our partner pilot efforts could come together to support our intended impact; was able to produce user research artifacts that we could then use to guide us in the build process; and was able to build an end to end prototype off of PySyft ready to be tested by users.</p>
                <p class="body-l">The next steps from here were to recruit potential users and begin testing our prototype against our assumptions. You can read about how we tested this prototype in the next portfolio item “PyGrid 0.6.0 // Early Access Group”.</p>
