                OpenMined is an open-source community and non-profit focused (at the time of this project) on the lowering of Privacy Preserving Technologies (PETs). Their core product is a Python Data Science library called PySyft. At the time of this project they had finished initial RnD around a new Differential Privacy Budgeting mechanic and were looking at ways in which it could be used to help researchers be better stewards of their participants’ data. At this point we had already determined our theory of change, defined our audience, and created a testable MVP prototype of our web app and python API experience. To read more about that process please visit portfolio item “<a href="../use-cases/pygrid-0-6-0-summer-2021.html">PyGrid 0.6.0 // Triaging Data Release Requests with Differential Privacy</a>”. What we needed at this stage was to recruit potential users that fit our target audience definitions and have them test our prototype. <em>(Due to NDA all potentially sensitive org information has been masked, generalized, or omitted from text & images)</em>

                        Unlike other user testing scenarios, this series of user testing needed to test across 2 touchpoints. Privacy Preserving Technology in general is a niche field and we knew that users would have to be educated on what Differential Privacy was at a baseline level in order to use it. We needed to test whether our education materials helped users feel comfortable enough with Differential Privacy to use our new feature. We also needed to test whether users found the new differential privacy feature desirable, viable for their research, and usable. What we decided upon was an early access program that would give users early access to the education team’s new course and our prototype. After each lesson within the course early access participants would be directed to complete a user research exercise whether that be filling out a survey, recording themselves completing a prompted activity, or whether that be submitting materials like Jupyter notebooks.

                        My work involved collaborating with the education team to determine how and what user research exercises would weave into their course material. The outcomes from this phase were a formal program definition and a Figma Jam content space used between me and the education team to map user research activities to course lessons and concepts (see above).

                        The Early Access 0.6.0 program was a 3 week program (Nov 11, 2021 - Nov 25, 2021) that walked 19 participants through the new 0.6.0 version of PyGrid and PySyft. Participants were taught about the new vision and features behind the 0.6.0 release via the newly created ‘Private AI Series’ course “Introduction to Remote Data Science”. Through a private course viewing, participants individually and remotely went through the new course; testing out features and giving feedback via surveys and unmoderated recordings along the way. Participants were given private Slack channels to have individual support for experience stopping bugs and issues along the way.

                        Given the resources we had available to give support to early testers I alongside with the education team, the outreach team and leadership determined that the size of this early access group should be between 10-20 participants. To help us determine outreach efforts and education content priority I along with the education team and outreach team took our audience definitions from the earlier “Define Audience” workshops and refined their definitions to give us audience segment tiers that we could then use to determine who to accept and not accept into this first early access group.  We then worked together to create outreach materials, to track participant applications, and to onboard accepted applicants. Some materials created in this time are as follows:

                        After the 20 participants were confirmed, they were given onboarding materials that outlined the scope, timeline, and cadence of the program. On their own time within that timeframe they took the course and completed the user research exercises linked with each lesson. Individual Slack channels were setup for them to keep communication open. Within those channels the support team and I were able to capture feature ideas, general feedback, and were able to address and create tickets out of bugs. A code of conduct was created for any OpenMined support members, within that document it was made clear that bugs could be worked through with participants but broader principles like explaining the product’s workflows would prime the tester and ruin testing.

                        Created surveys, interview outlines, and activity prompts. Unmoderated test activities took the form of Lookback links. Within the Lookback session a general scenario was outlined along with an objective. participants could use the link to record and submit screenshare videos of them completing the activity.

                        I worked with the Education Team and Engineering team to create a user support plan whereby we defined how we would listen for tester feedback and help log bug-related issues versus general feedback across tester touchpoints which included: GitHub Issues, our general Slack channels, and the tester specific GitHub Discussions forum channels.

                        I interviewed users both through 1:1 meetings via Google Meets or through Slack messaging on their individual channels. This depended on user preference some users preferred async interviewing either because of language as a barrier or because of timezone scheduling constraints.

                        After the end of the cohort testing participants were given a certificate of completion to show our appreciation for their time and effort. It was then time for me to gather any extraneous feedback and review the results. I reviewed user feedback gathered from… conducted surveys, activity recordings, Slack Support messages, GitHub added Issues, and GitHub Discussion activity made by the testers. I then summarized insights, findings, and product suggestions in a formal user research report. I presented the findings from this report to the core team to help alignment and drive user-centered thinking. I concluded this phase of wrap-up by making recommendations to the PyGrid 0.7.0 product roadmap. These recommendations took the form of suggested engineering cycles, suggested features, suggested product reworks/product strategy discussions and were backlogged in the appropriate channels (more immediately actionable ones were logged as Issues in GitHub, broader ones were logged as pending discussion in our project management system).

                        I wanted to wrap-up not just by summarizing what our planned exercises revealed but by also understanding and logging the insights gathered from involved team members. Therefore to officially wrap-up the initiative, I held a team retrospective where those involved could voice what they observed, how they would improve not just the product but our processes going forward, and for them to celebrate and praise what they thought went well. This retrospective took the form of a 45min Miro workshop where I had our team members brainstorm answers to specific prompts individually and then come together to show and tell 1-4 of the answers they wrote.

                    I found that conducting user research on behalf of an open source community attracted a lot of good will, eagerness, and a feeling of being in the trenches with Early Access Program participants. Many were very energetic in giving feedback and starting discussion. I also found that when testing across timezones and with those who may not have English as a first language, direct message interviews and asynchronous activities with clearly written scenarios were the most successful. Lastly I found that the approach of combining education material with research exercises was polarizing with participants. Those who latched onto it went above and beyond to join the conversation, even becoming OpenMined contributors after the program ended. Meanwhile those who did not fell off during testing due to the amount of effort needed to both learn the material and give feedback via a test. We had a small test size to begin with (20), having more then 2 drop-off was significant. In the end this meant that the feedback we got was in-depth but had less breadth over the entirety than I would have liked. Because of this outcome we now conduct single test exercises when the learning curb is high and conduct tinkering type programs when the audience group is generalized.

                    Feedback from this Early Access Group was then used as a foundation to help the Partners team formalize a strategy behind a larger scale academic outreach initiative called “The Federated Medical Learning Program” by which they recruited 100 academic health institutions to run a pilot around breast cancer research using PySyft.

                    Product specific feedback directly funneled into another release cycle by which we iterated on the Differential Privacy feature using Early Access feedback. A version of this iteration can be seen in the next portfolio item, “PyGrid 0.7.0 // Helping a Data Owner identify ranges needed for Differential Privacy”.

                    Early Access Group feedback directly affected the curriculum of the following course created by the education team; where real-world applications of Privacy Preserving Technologies (PETs) was then emphasized along with mini lessons on how to use specific PETs.
