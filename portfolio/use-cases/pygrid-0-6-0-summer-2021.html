                OpenMined is an open-source community and non-profit focused (at the time of this project) on the lowering of Privacy Preserving Technologies (PETs). Their core product is a Python Data Science library called PySyft. At the time of this project they had finished initial RnD around a new Differential Privacy Budgeting mechanic and were looking at ways in which it could be used to help researchers be better stewards of their participants’ data. I was brought on board to act both as the User Research Lead and as the UX/UI designer to investigate viability into incorporating this mechanic into a web app experience. During the time of this project (6 months) I helped them formalize a theory of change, collaborated with leadership & engineering teams to construct a testable MVP, and coordinated with education & outreach teams to conduct an early access test group of that MVP. <em>(Due to NDA all potentially sensitive org information has been masked, generalized, or omitted from text & images)</em>

                        Now that we had established clear audience segments and the foundation to our theory of change I wanted to get an understanding of our users' day to day. The group we wanted to understand the most were those in academic research who had gathered data (Data Owners) to advance their field’s research, but who had to make sure they were good stewards of what was released with that data to protect participants in the study (Data Subjects). Qualitative research was conducted where I interviewed principal investigators at Lausanne University Hospital and had weekly calls with an SME at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) from which our education team and leadership team were walked through the typical flow of the research proposal process and how privacy concerns played a role in that process.

                        Discussing what we learned from the user research exercises, we narrowed our problem set to focus on how our product could streamline the triaging process behind saying yes or no to a data release request. At this point we felt that we had enough internal alignment to go forward with creating a testable MVP. For this group it felt best to ideate via Jeff Patton's <a href="https://jpattonassociates.com/story-mapping/">storymapping framework</a> with slight alterations to better fit the current problem set. Through weekly sessions I held storymapping workshops with the engineering lead, our internal SME, and leadership to determine the core activities our key users would want to conduct with our product. We then iterated to determine priority, sectioning off ideas as MVP requirements versus “nice to haves” which would be ideas that we could revisit later for future prototypes. The outcome of these activities was a core userflow mapped out for engineering and design to then use in the build process.

                        How can Data Access Agreements and Differential Privacy be incorporated into a request triage process that makes it easier to track what is being released and requested from your org's data?

                        The MVP we made proposed that the triaging process could be streamlined by giving external researchers with signed DAA’s access to preliminary automatic results obfuscated through a Differential Privacy algorithm. This process would have two primary users; the Data Owner who would be triaging requests and the semi-trust Researcher which in the product we generally call the Data Scientist who would be making the requests. Data Scientists who have signed a DAA would form together their projects by remotely computing off the data using what is called a privacy budget. In this case a privacy budget would act similarily to a credit limit, a Data Scientist would be allowed to have a certain amount of visibility into the dataset given by the Data Owner, any result that went past that limit would get obfuscated by the Differential Privacy algorithm. This would allow more accuracy in the forming of projects without having to be on the premises of where the data was held and without having to give a copy of the data away. After forming their projects on the obfuscated results, Data Scientists could then submit a “Data Release” request whereby they ask the Data Owner for the final non-obfuscated result. The Data Owner triaging workflow proposed was as follows:

                    After 3 months of collaboration and iteration our team was able to align on the big picture view of what impact we wanted to make towards the privacy problem; was able to define a theory of change of how our product build efforts, our education efforts, and our partner pilot efforts could come together to support our intended impact; was able to produce user research artifacts that we could then use to guide us in the build process; and was able to build an e2e prototype of our web app ready to be tested with users.
                </p>
                <p class="body-l">
                    The next steps from here were to recruit potential users and begin testing our prototype to see if our assumptions were going in the right direction or if we needed to go back to the drawing board. You can read about how we tested this prototype in the next portfolio item “PyGrid 0.6.0 // Early Access Group”.
