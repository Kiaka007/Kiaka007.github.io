                <p>The main methods for achieving page layout in CSS all involve specifying values for the display property. This property allows us to change the default way something displays. Everything in normal flow has a default value for display; i.e., a default way that elements are set to behave. For example, the fact that paragraphs in English display one below the other is because they are styled with display: block. If you create a link around some text inside a paragraph, that link remains inline with the rest of the text, and doesn't break onto a new line. This is because the a element is display: inline by default.</p>
                <p>You can change this default display behavior. For example, the li element is display: block by default, meaning that list items display one below the other in our English document. If we were to change the display value to inline they would display next to each other, as words would do in a sentence. The fact that you can change the value of display for any element means that you can pick HTML elements for their semantic meaning without being concerned about how they will look. The way they look is something that you can change.</p>
