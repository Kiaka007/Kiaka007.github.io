                            it clicked—the calling.

                        <p>
                            I became the engine that filled the sky <br>
                            with smoke. A mantra became my pillow <br>
                            and then my blindfold.

                            anchored to a floral couch on <br>
                            Oaken Bucket Drive where a van waits <br>
